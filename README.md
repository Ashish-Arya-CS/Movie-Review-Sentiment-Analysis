# Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analysis
I have made a sentiment analysis model which takes in movie reviews and categorize them either as positive or negative.I have made use of RNN in this model and it is categorizing the movie reviews quite correctly.
This repo also contains a notebook for time series prediction using RNNs.
